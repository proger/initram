A simple script set to generate a working gzipped initramfs
supporting root=LABEL= and root=UUID= kernel arguments.

The dependencies are blkid(8) from util-linux and busybox.

Scripts are based on mkinitcpio from Arch Linux:
http://projects.archlinux.org/mkinitcpio.git

Key differences are:
- It is small!

- I use it to build cpio images for kernels of other architecture
  (i686 on x86_64).
  If you want this to work, you need to have either lib32 libs
  on your lib64 machine or tweak the dependency discovery
  routine in genfiles.sh

- The need for udev is replaced by 8 lines of shell.

I do not need any other features now, but feel free to add :)
